        "This study explores river water quality across South Africa using exploratory analysis to better understand how environmental and human-related factors may influence conditions in rivers. Water quality samples were collected at river monitoring locations between 2011 and 2015, covering both inland rivers and rivers near the coast. To provide additional context for each sampling location, these measurements were combined with satellite data, climate information, population density, and indicators of how close each site is to a river mouth. Satellite observations help describe surface and moisture conditions, climate data capture broader weather influences, population density reflects nearby human activity, and river mouth proximity helps distinguish downstream and coastal effects from upstream conditions. Together, these data are used to examine patterns and relationships in three key water quality measures—Total Alkalinity (TA), Electrical Conductance (EC), and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP)—and to gain insights into the factors associated with variation in river water quality.\n"

        "<p align=\"justify\"> In this notebook, we demonstrate a basic workflow that serves as a foundation for the challenge. The model has been developed to predict <b>water quality parameters</b> using features derived from the <b>Landsat</b> and <b>TerraClimate</b> datasets. Specifically, four spectral bands—<b>SWIR22</b> (Shortwave Infrared 2), <b>NIR</b> (Near Infrared), <b>Green</b>, and <b>SWIR16</b> (Shortwave Infrared 1)—were utilized from Landsat, along with derived spectral indices such as <b>NDMI</b> (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and <b>MNDWI</b> (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). In addition, the <b>PET</b> (Potential Evapotranspiration) variable was incorporated from the <b>TerraClimate</b> dataset to account for climatic influences on water quality. </p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\"> The dataset spans a five-year period from <b>2011 to 2015</b>. Using <b>API-based data extraction</b> methods, both Landsat and TerraClimate features were retrieved directly from the <a href=\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Planetary Computer</a> portal. These combined spectral, index-based, and climatic features were used as predictors in a regression model to estimate three key water quality parameters: <b>Total Alkalinity (TA)</b>, <b>Electrical Conductance (EC)</b>, and <b>Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP)</b>.\n",
        "\n",
        "</p> <p align=\"justify\"> Please note that this notebook serves only as a starting point. Several assumptions were made during the data extraction and model development process, which you may find opportunities to improve upon. Participants are encouraged to explore additional features, enhance preprocessing techniques, or experiment with different regression algorithms to optimize predictive performance. </p>"

        "We determined the river mouth distance threshold empirically by examining how the number of sampling points classified as “river mouth” changed across increasing distance cutoffs. The count of river-mouth points stabilizes at approximately 10–11 km, indicating a natural spatial cluster corresponding to true river mouth and immediate estuarine influence. Below this range, the threshold is too restrictive and excludes relevant points; above 12 km, the number of points increases sharply, suggesting inclusion of downstream river segments rather than true mouth locations. Based on this stability and interpretability, we selected a 10 km threshold as a conservative and robust definition of river mouth proximity."

        "<p align=\"justify\">We will now split the data into 70% training data and 30% test data. Scikit-learn alias “sklearn” is a robust library for machine learning in Python. The scikit-learn library has a <i><b>model_selection</b></i> module in which there is a splitting function <i><b>train_test_split</b></i>. You can use the same.</p>\n",

        "<p align=\"justify\"> Before initiating the model training we may have to execute different data pre-processing steps. Here we are demonstrating the scaling of 'swir22','NDMI','MNDWI','pet' variable by using Standard Scaler.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align = \"justify\">Feature Scaling is a data preprocessing step for numerical features. Many machine learning algorithms like Gradient descent methods, KNN algorithm, linear and logistic regression, etc. require data scaling to produce good results. Scikit learn provides functions that can be used to apply data scaling. Here we are using Standard Scaler. The idea behind Standard Scaler is that it will transform your data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1.</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Training\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
        "Now that we have the data in a format suitable for machine learning, we can begin training our models. In this demonstration notebook, we will build three separate regression models — one for each target water quality parameter: Total Alkalinity, Electrical Conductance, and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus.\n",
        "Each model will be trained independently to capture the unique relationships between the satellite-derived features and each parameter.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
        "We will use the Random Forest Regressor from the scikit-learn library to build our models. Scikit-learn provides a wide range of regression algorithms with extensive parameter tuning and customization capabilities.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
        "For model training, the predictor variables (e.g., SWIR22, NDMI, MNDWI, and pet) will be stored in an array X, and the response variable (one of the three water quality parameters) will be stored in an array Y.\n",
        "It is important not to include the response variable in X. Additionally, since latitude, longitude, and sample date are only used for spatial and temporal reference, they will be excluded from the predictor variables during model training.\n",
        "</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "### Model Evaluation\n",
        "<p align=\"justify\">\n",
        "Now that we have trained our models for the three water quality parameters, the next step is to evaluate their performance. Each regression model for Total Alkalinity, Electrical Conductance, and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus is assessed using the R² score and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The R² score measures how well the model explains the variance in the observed values, while RMSE quantifies the average magnitude of prediction errors. Together, these metrics help determine how effectively each model captures variations in water quality across different locations and sampling dates. Scikit-learn provides built-in functions to compute these metrics, and participants may explore additional evaluation methods or custom metrics as needed.</p>\n"
