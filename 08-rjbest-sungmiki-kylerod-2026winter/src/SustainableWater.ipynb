    "Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis of water quality across various river locations in South Africa! As a key factor for environmental sustainability, we would like to use data to identify and emphasize the key factors that significantly influence water quality. As a team we will take advantage of the valuable opportunity to apply data exploration techniques to real-world environmental data and contribute to advancing water quality monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a dataset containing three target water quality parameters **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus** collected between 2011 and 2015 from approximately 200 river locations across South Africa, our goal is to find insight on which environmental conditions most affect these 3 metrics. Each data point includes the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the sampling site, the date of collection, and the corresponding water quality measurements. Features of the dataset also include four spectral bands—**SWIR22** (Shortwave Infrared 2), **NIR** (Near Infrared), **Green**, and **SWIR16** (Shortwave Infrared 1)—were utilized from Landsat, along with derived spectral indices such as **NDMI** (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and **MNDWI** (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). In addition, the **PET** (Potential Evapotranspiration) variable was incorporated from the **TerraClimate** dataset to account for climatic influences on water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SWIR22** – Sensitive to surface moisture and turbidity variations in water bodies.  \n",
    "- **NIR** – Helps in identifying vegetation and suspended matter in water.  \n",
    "- **Green** – Useful for detecting water color and surface reflectance changes.  \n",
    "- **SWIR16** – Provides information on surface dryness and sediment concentration.  \n",
    "- **NDMI** – Derived from NIR and SWIR16, indicates moisture and vegetation–water interaction.  \n",
    "- **MNDWI** – Derived from Green and SWIR22, effective for distinguishing open water areas and reducing built-up noise.  \n",
    "- **PET** – Extracted from the TerraClimate dataset, represents potential evapotranspiration influencing hydrological and water quality dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset spans a five-year period from 2011 to 2015. Using API-based data extraction methods, both Landsat and TerraClimate features were retrieved directly from the <a href=\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Planetary Computer</a> portal. These combined spectral, index-based, and climatic features were used as predictors in a regression model to estimate three key water quality parameters: Total Alkalinity (TA), Electrical Conductance (EC), and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Secondary Datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our secondary datasets comprise gridded population estimation from <a href=\"https://hub.worldpop.org/project/categories?id=18\">WorldPop :: Population Density</a> and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_South_Africa\">List of rivers of South Africa</a> from Wikipedia. The population density data includes geographical coordinates and the number of people per square kilometre based on country totals adjusted to match the corresponding official United Nations population estimates that have been prepared by the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat (<a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/\">2019 Revision of World Population Prospects</a>). The list of rivers dataset includes river name, province and location, source location and mouth/junction at their location name and geographical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gridded population estimates are particularly useful as they provide decision-makers and data users with the flexibility to aggregate population estimates into different spatial units in existing enumeration areas or custom areas. Estimated population density per grid-cell. The projection is Geographic Coordinate System, WGS84. \n",
    "- The water sources of each quality sample in our original data are linked to geographical coordinates. So, we will use a simple list of rivers to reference each sample to its nominal water source.\n",
